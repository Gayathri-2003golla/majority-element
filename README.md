The logic of the code is:

1.Initialize Candidates and Counters:
candidate1, candidate2: These variables represent the potential majority elements.
count1, count2: These variables represent the counters for the corresponding candidates.
Initialize candidate1, candidate2 to distinct values, and set both counters to 0.

2.Find Candidates:
Iterate through the array:
If the current element is equal to candidate1, increment count1.
If the current element is equal to candidate2, increment count2.
If count1 is 0, update candidate1 to the current element and set count1 to 1.
If count2 is 0, update candidate2 to the current element and set count2 to 1.
If neither of the above conditions is met, decrement both counters.

3.Count Occurrences of Candidates:
Reset count1 and count2 to 0.
Iterate through the array again:
If the current element is equal to candidate1, increment count1.
If the current element is equal to candidate2, increment count2.

4.Check for Majority Elements:
If count1 is greater than ⌊ n/3 ⌋, add candidate1 to the result.
If count2 is greater than ⌊ n/3 ⌋, add candidate2 to the result.

5.Return Result:
The result contains the elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.







The algorithm of the code is:


Step 1: Initialization

Initialize two candidates (candidate1 and candidate2) and their respective counters (count1 and count2).
candidate1, candidate2: Initialize to distinct values (e.g., 0 and 1).
count1, count2: Initialize to 0.

Step 2: Find Candidates
Iterate through the array:
If the current element is equal to candidate1, increment count1.
If the current element is equal to candidate2, increment count2.
If count1 is 0, update candidate1 to the current element and set count1 to 1.
If count2 is 0, update candidate2 to the current element and set count2 to 1.
If neither of the above conditions is met, decrement both count1 and count2.

Step 3: Count Occurrences of Candidates
Reset count1 and count2 to 0.
Iterate through the array again:
If the current element is equal to candidate1, increment count1.
If the current element is equal to candidate2, increment count2.

Step 4: Check for Majority Elements
If count1 is greater than ⌊ n/3 ⌋, add candidate1 to the result.
If count2 is greater than ⌊ n/3 ⌋, add candidate2 to the result.

Step 5: Return Result
The result contains the elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.
